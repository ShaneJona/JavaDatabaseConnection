1. This file includes Java code that connects users to a MySQL database.
2. This java code is an example and if used should be altered to fit the users needs.

Please note:

1. You must locate the Executable Jar File datatype "mysql-connector-java-5.1.13-bin"
located inside the Mysql-connector-hava-5.1.13-bin folder and add to your Java Resources/Libraries
otherwise the connection between your Java software and database won't connect.

2. I use Netbeans IDE 7.2 for this project.

3. There could be possible bugs with connection depending on Database filetype.
